# CLI
<p class="uk-article-lead"> GreenCheap, provides developers with some of their core functions through the command-line interface (CLI). A number of commands are available that offer useful tools and assistants. </p>

## Basic use

Open a terminal and go to the directory of an existing GreenCheap installation. The `greencheap` (no file extension) script in this directory is a PHP script that can run commands.

```sh
cd /var/www/greencheap   # navigate to greencheap directory
./greencheap             # run greencheap CLI script
```

**Note** You may need to make this script executable using `chmod +x greencheap`. Alternatively, you can explicitly call your PHP interpreter `php greencheap`.

Options:
      --dir[=DIR]       Write the archive to this directory
```

### Create GreenCheap Version Archive

This command, used by GreenCheap maintainers to create a GreenCheap release package.  It will create a `*.zip` archive in the root folder of the GreenCheap installation. This release package can then be used both as a download package from the official GreenCheap website and as a custom installation that you can deliver, etc. your customers.

### View usage information for any CLI command

To find out what a CLI command actually does and how it is used, you can use the "help" command.

```
Usage:
  help [options] [--] [<command_name>]

To run any transport that needs to be run, you can use the `migrate` command. Generally, you don't need to do this clearly. When you log in to the admin field, GreenCheap will also check for any transports and run them if necessary.

```sh
./greencheap migrate
```

In this case, you must also provide a valid SHA hash that is used to verify the downloaded file. If you do not provide a URL and hash, the command will use the latest GreenCheap package in greencheap.net.

```sh
./greencheap self-update
```

```sh
Usage:
  self-update [options]

An example of setting up greencheap using SQLite and the default administrator user:

```sh
./greencheap setup --password=<SOMETHING-SECURE>
```

```sh
./greencheap start --server=127.0.0.1:8080
```

```
Usage:
  start [options]

  -s, --server[=SERVER]  Server name and port [default: "127.0.0.1:8080"]
```

### Parse the translation strings in the package

When creating a theme or extension, you can and should use Greencheap's internationalization system to ensure that the user interface can be displayed in multiple languages. Basically, custom function calls to these strings (etc. In PHP templates `__('Translate me!')` Or Vue templates `{{ 'Translate me!' |trans }}` works by turning. `extension:translate` commands, it will find all occurrences of such function calls in a particular theme or extension, and collect all translatable strings for you, and pack them in the specified package `languages/`. These files can then be used to create translations for your package, for example using a service like [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/greencheap/greencheap-cms/).

For Example:

```sh
./greencheap extension:translate greencheap/blog
```

Usage and arguments:

```sh
Usage:
  extension:translate [<extension>]

Arguments:
  extension             Extension name
```

### Bring new translation files

**Deprecated Warning** This command will be changed.

This command, by greencheap's core minders, used to retrieve translations from the GreenCheap translation pool. The translation workflow and file structure are currently being discussed, and this command will likely be modified in a future version of Greencheap.

Example:

```sh
./greencheap translation:fetch
```

Usage:

```sh
Usage:
  translation:fetch
```
