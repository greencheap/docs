<p class="uk-article-lead">When you start using GreenCheap, it is important to know your path around the file structure. GreenCheap, the core code and third-party files are very clearly separated, this should not be too important.</p>

## Places to explore

Although it takes a while to get used to the structure of a new project, you'll quickly find your way through important parts. The most important thing you need to know, in the `/packages` directory of themes and extensions that you always develop, it is located in a subfolder that contains your vendor name. The vendor name can be your company name or public user name, for example, our vendor name goes through greencheap.

Also, for inspiration and a better understanding of the concept of greencheap, it is a good idea to look at official packages found in `/packages/greencheap`. Also, check the `/app/modules` and `/app/system/modules` modules for examples of what can be done with a module pattern.
